# Real Time Content
 Objects created in After Effects can contain Real Time content. See the module in Chapter 6 for real time graphics. 


1. In your layout, add the MOV asset that contains Real Time content.
2. Select the asset in your layout.
3. Switch to the Info tab and expand the Real Time Tags heading.

Use the fields to update the Real Time content. The next time the layout is output, the updated content displays.

> Note: After editing a field, you must click outside of the Real Time Tags panel in order to finalize your changes.

> Note: If the layout is currently being output and it is not paused, the content will update on-air. Variables which change their values during playback, however, will not update automatically on-air.

## Updating all types of Real Time Content
 

If your Real Time content includes a network path to an image or clip file, edit the path to change the file that is used.
1. Select the object that contains Real Time content in your layout.
2. Switch to the Info tab and expand the Real Time Tags heading.
3. Click on the field that you'd like to edit, and enter the new path and filename that you'd like to use.

 The next time the layout is output, the updated content displays.

 >   Note: You can use either MOV files or image files.
