# What is Creation Station? 
-    Create graphics layouts
-    Publish layouts
-    Offline version
-    Browser Based Tools

The Creation Station for Versio™ includes the tools you need to create graphics layouts with a consistent brand identity across all your on-air programming items. After you create your graphics layouts using the Creation Station tools you can publish the layouts to the Versio system for output. The Creation Station is installed on a dedicated system and includes offline versions of the browser-based Console tools as well as the IconStation application.


## Creation Station Lite
Released with Versio 4. 

I keep hearing this term `CSL` is that the same? 

Creation  Station  Lite  is  an  off-line  graphics  creation  tool  based  on  the  new  web-based  Versio  Graphics  UI within  Versio.  It  is  intended  to  work  in  conjunction  with  Versio  Content  Portal and  Versio  Automation, but  can  also  be  used  with  Versio  systems  running  ADC. 

So CSL and Creation Station are the same?  

No, there are differing UIs and tools to be used in CSL. This is areating  differentiation  between  Creation  Station  (legacy)  and  new 

Works as a stand-alone or  connected  to  Content Portal 
- Stand-alone:  download  layout  to  local  PC  as  .lyt  (must  import  .lyt  on  another instance  of Versio  Graphics) 
- Content Portal:  publish  layout  to  central repository  for use  by  Content  Portal and  Versio Automation 

**Versio Graphics  HTML-5  web  client**  for layout  creation,  editing,  salvo/macro  editing,  preview control  and  layout  management 
- Inclusion  of JPEG or  PNG stills  and  MOV  QuickTime Animations
