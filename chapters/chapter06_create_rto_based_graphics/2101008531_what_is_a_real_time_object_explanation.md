# RealTime Objects
Real Time (RT) enables you to update text and other content in your After Effects MOV files in Versio Platform. When you update the content in Versio Platform, the animation’s content updates before going to air.

> Note: You can use RT content in combination with your CTC animations. For details about CTC animations, see Content Triggering Content

## RealTime Rules 

Before designing an animation with Real Time content, it is important to understand the following rules and limitations.

• Make sure the fonts that are used in the MOV file for Real Time text are licensed and present on the Versio Platform system.
- The duration of the composition must be equal to the animation length.
- The supported attributes and features in this release include:
	- Solid font colors.
	- Font size.
	- Rounded corners on rectangle shapes.
	- The following transformations - anchor, position, scale, rotation, and opacity.
	- Gaussian blur is supported.
- The unsupported attributes and features in this release (versio 4.6) include: 
	- Faux bold, kerning, and drop shadows.
	- Paragraph text objects.
