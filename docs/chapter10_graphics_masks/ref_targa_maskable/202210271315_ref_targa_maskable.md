# Reference - Maskable Targa &  PNG Sequences

!!! success 
    As part of [VMGMT-9602](https://imaginecommunications.atlassian.net/browse/VMGMT-9602) we now have the ability to mark a targa sequence as Real Time in After Effects and have it play back with Versio Graphics. Ability to dynamically alter a targa sequence configured as Real Time using the Graphics UI. (In other words we want Active Textures with sequences.)Ability to mask a sequence configured as Real Time. All of the above for png sequences (instead of targa). This was implememted in versio-graphics 20.0.0.400.
