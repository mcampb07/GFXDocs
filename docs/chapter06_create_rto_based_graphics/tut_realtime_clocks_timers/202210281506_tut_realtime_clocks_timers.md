# Tutorial - Clocks - Timers - Counters

In this session tutorial we are going to put into practice what we just learnt on realtime clocks and timers.

In this sesssion you will need the following:

- [RealTime_Clocks_2210.aep](../../downloads/202210281506_tut_realtime_clocks_timers/RealTime_Clocks_2210.aep)

!!! tip 
    Try not to use this example in the session, but rather build your own real time text pull and requery. You can use this example if you get stuck and use it for reference. But you need to start creating theses items, real time layers, comp markers for CTC on your own - LEARN BY DOING!

## Session Objective

- Build a new comp for each of the following: 
   - time - hh:mm:ss.ms - or whatever format you decide
   - date - mmmm dddd mm yyyy - or whatever format you decide
   - date and time combo
- Create new layouts on the Creation Station and create the following types:
   - 24hr clock
   - 12hr clock
   - Count Down to 
   - Count Up
