# Tutorial - Create a Crawl

In this session we need to create a crawl. I have provided examples in the following download:

- [RT_Crawl_Scroll_2210.aep](../../downloads/202210280831_tut_crawl/RT_Crawl_Scroll_2210.aep)

However, rather than taking the examples only, I want you to follow the session objectives:

##Â Session Objectives

- Create a new crawl in After Effects after reviewing the previous session and taking on board what you now know
   - add 1 real time text item in the crawl 
   - add 1 real time active texture item - story separator
- Create a new layout in CSL 
   - Link the real time items as needed
   - Static text 
   - Static active texture

!!! warning
    Once you have completed the above session objective, pause. Next we you need to learn about external data and not just static data. Once you have had that lesson, link the crawl real time text to an extenal data source.
