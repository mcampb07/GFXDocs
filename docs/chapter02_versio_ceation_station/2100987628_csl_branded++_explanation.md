# Branded ++
If the Versio system's playback mode is set to Branded++ you can assign individual layout objects to play on channel 1, channel 2, or both channels.

With the layout open in Versio Graphics, select the object from the Objects list.

- 2: Plays the object on channel two.

Use the Canvas Preview menu to only view the objects in the workspace that are set to air on the selected channel(s).
