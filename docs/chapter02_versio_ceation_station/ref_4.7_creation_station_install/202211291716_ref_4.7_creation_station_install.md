# Versio 4.7 Creation Station Install Reference

!!! info
    What is the difference from this version to previous? There is a Zenium Blueprint that produces a Web RTC output. This solves the issue of having to use a Silverlight browser for the preview of graphics. 


## Versio Creation Station 4.7 Resource Requirement

To be determined, but it should not be far from the previous hardware and software requirements as detaile in the 4.3 release. 


## Install Steps

- Run the installation script from the Administrator shell. The machine will be rebooted a couple of times.

## Configuration of CSL 4.7

With the Magellan Configuration page removed - how do we configure this CSL to be HD? NTSC?  Located at `C:/programdata/IC/Creation Station Lite/config.json` is our configuration file.

```json
{
    "program": {
        "video": {
            "remark": "Video format of the signal (background + graphics)",
            "standard": "PAL",
            "standardValues": ["NTSC", "PAL"],
            "resolution": "1080i",
            "resolutionValues": ["SD", "720p", "1080i", "1080p"],
            "pattern": "MovingBar",
            "patternValues": ["Black", "ColorBars", "MovingBar", "Gradient", "Multi-purpose"]
        },
        "audio": {
            "remark": "Audio is hardcoded to 8 channels x 32 bps for now (as in Versio)"
        }
    },
    "output": {
        "remark": "WebRTC output is always progressive because of H.264 baseline profile, given the height, the width will be calculated from the signal aspect ratio",
        "resolution": 360,
        "resolutionValues": [360, 480, 720, 1080]
    }
}
```
Use the PS script in that directory to apply the settings.
