# Versio Graphics Supported Font Types

Question - Can Versio handle .otf font types? Used a .ttf font and it works no problem... 

An [OTF file ](https://lite.duckduckgo.com/lite?q=what%20is%20.otf)is a font saved in the OpenType format developed by Microsoft and Adobe. 
The OpenType format combines aspects of the PostScript ( .PS) and TrueType ( .TTF) font formats. OTF fonts are fully scalable, meaning their characters can be resized without losing quality

A [TTF file ](https://lite.duckduckgo.com/lite?q=what%20is%20.ttf)is a font that can be installed in macOS, Windows, and other platforms. It is saved in the TrueType font format, which was created by Apple. TrueType fonts can be resized to any size without losing quality and look the same when printed as they do on the screen

So can Versio Graphics handle OTF? Yes and No, it can be hit and miss. Usually its an issue of it not being able to resolve the package/weight names.

What to do? Try the font... if it doesn't render or find, convert to TTF type. 

TTF usually yields better results over OTF.
