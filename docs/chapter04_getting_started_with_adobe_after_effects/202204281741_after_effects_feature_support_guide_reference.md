## After Effects Feature Support
The following table outlines what is supported in After Effects when building Real Time graphics for Versio.If a feature is not listed please inquire but its safe to assume it may not be supported.

### Building Comps
 > Note Physical compositions and Precomp support. The Composition should be rendered to match your output resolution.
