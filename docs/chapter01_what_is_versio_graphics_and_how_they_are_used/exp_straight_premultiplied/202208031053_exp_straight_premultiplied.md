# Rendering Graphics - Straight or Pre-multiplied?

In the After Effects world we have the option to render `straight` or `premultiplied.  Never heard of it? Watch this video...

## Veriso (Phoenix) Does it care? 

Yes, yes, yes ... Versio or rather the graphics component on the server - `Phoenix` definitaly does care about the graphics you send it whether it is `straight` or `pre-multiplied`... If you render in one state and the server is configured in another state - it is going to get weird!

Can set the Versio Server to handle straight or pre-multiplied? Yes. It is not a file by file option it is an overall server setting:
Itâ€™s all or nothing for everything played through libav provider.

Set `LibavProviderPreMultiplied` under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Inscriber\StreamEffect2` to `0` instead of `1`.

In summary, you need to make the decision in the early stages of your new Versio installation - are we using `straight` or `pre-multiplied`
