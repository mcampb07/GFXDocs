# Versio Graphics Terminology
- Layout
   - A Versio Graphics term that is used to describe a graphic that is holding a number of objects and macros.
- Object 
   - An object is an an item that is loaded into a layout, png, wav mov for example
- CTC 
   - CTC Stands for Content Triggering Content. CTC allows control of playback through the use of named triggers. When building graphics, a designer can add markers to a timeline which are stored as XMP metdata on render. Versio Graphics parses this data allowing you to build your logic directly into flattened animations. Loops, pauses, crawls, DVEs, Real Time text can all be created using CTC.
- Expressions 
   - Expressions are a form of JavaScript that can be created on objects in After Effects. Expressions on text transformation are exported to Versio Graphics and parsed by the system. Your real time text and support the expression rules built in after effects.
- Prog Salvo 
   - A Prog Salvo is a single automation event supported in ADC. It contains the logic to Setup, Show and Hide specific objects in 3 different Salvos.
- Macro 
   - A Macro is a concept supported only in Versio 4. A macro contains the logic for how graphics behave when setup, shown and hidden. This allows a single event in automation to handle multiple states of the graphic.
- Salvo 
   - A salvo is a named timeline that can be fired by a user or automation. A salvo lives within a layout and is used to show or hide one to many objects.Â  Salvos can contain transition effects on objects and special commands such as triggers or audio ducking.
- Scripting 
   - Scripting refers to the Extend Script language used by Adobe.
- XMP
   - The Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP) is an ISO standard, originally created by Adobe Systems Inc., for the creation, processing and interchange of standardized and custom metadata for digital documents and data sets.
- Active Texture
   - An Active Texture is what use to describe a realtime object that is not a text based item. An image in the realtime scenario is known as an Active Texture.
