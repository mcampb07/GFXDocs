# Tutorial - Basic Graphics Creation

Once we have covered the previous modules covering the overview reviewing what all the differing components are that go to make up the Versio Graphics Solution. In this module, we are going to provide a very basic tutorial on how a graphical asset is added to a new layout, that layout is previewed, published and shown onair.  

It is a taster tutorial to show some of the user interfaces and get you comfortable with using the systems. 

- create a new layout
- add an image - png
