# Trimming the comp to the work area 
lets not render unused frames for no reason.  Lets trim our comp.

Working to keep your [After Effects](https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html#x) projects clean and tidy is no easy feat, and a huge part of that is making sure that your layers are trimmed. After Effects doesn't like looking at your empty layers anymore than you should. It's constantly analyzing and it needs a little guidance.

One of the ways we can help After Effects help us is by keeping our compositions trimmed. So let's dig into a super quick and easy way you can trim compositions by using your in and out points.

## How to trim 
Here's how to quickly trim your composition duration in After Effects.

Step 1: Set Your In and Out Points

Keyboard Shortcuts in After Effects:

-   In Point: B (the beginning)
    
-   Out Point: N (the end)

The first step in trimming your composition is to set your in and out points. By setting these points you are telling After Effects to only preview the timeline between the In and Out points. In After Effects you can set an In Point by pressing the 'B' key and an Out Point by pressing the 'N' key.

It's very important to set your In and Out Point before pushing your video into the render queue or [Adobe Media Encoder](https://www.adobe.com/products/media-encoder.html).

Step 2: Trim Comp to Work Area

Keyboard Shortcut in After Effects:

-   Trim Comp to Work Area:  macos `CMD+Shift+X` windows `ctrl+shift+x`
-   or right-click on it and select “Trim Comp to Work Area”
-   or menu - composition > trim comp to work area

Once you defined the work area go to the top of the program window and click "Composition". From here you'll simply select "Trim Comp to Work Area" and After Effects will trim the time duration of the composition you have selected.

Just like that, you've cleaned up one composition. If this was a pre-comp you've made some simple but great strides in organizing your After Effects composition like a true motion graphics master. This technique can even help your compositions preview and render faster.
