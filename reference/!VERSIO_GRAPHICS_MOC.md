Using training Pack - [PROMO SCALE](https://myimagine-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/jriver13_imaginecommunications_com/ElpdFd6zxbRCpEV0s1pgjp8BUOXzdk1gxNXmoWpoy6RqvA?e=rsYv3m)

Using training Pack - [Dynamic Width](https://myimagine-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/jriver13_imaginecommunications_com/ElpdFd6zxbRCpEV0s1pgjp8BUOXzdk1gxNXmoWpoy6RqvA?e=rsYv3m)

Using training Pack [Referenced Media](https://myimagine-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/jriver13_imaginecommunications_com/ElpdFd6zxbRCpEV0s1pgjp8BUOXzdk1gxNXmoWpoy6RqvA?e=rsYv3m)

	- D-Series Automation 

---

### Session 11 Dynamic Lower 3rd
- üéØ  In this session we will create 1 item, another promo, again this promo will hold realtime text objects - but in addition this example demonstrates how expressions can be used to make the design more scalable and adaptable to the content.

- The Subheader detects if there is a value of less than 2 characters and will hide and move the title and rating if its not present to keep the title aligned with the background.
- The Title will wrap and change its vertical position if its 1 or 2 lines moving the rating with it. 
- The Background will also expand/grow to match the length of the text.
- The NEXT text can also change and push everything to the right (This was only designed to handle short headings here)
- The ratings bug is also a real time object.
- This is a perfect example to connect to Content Portal using NNL.

Notes:
- Versio has an issue where it can‚Äôt detect the length of a text object if it is wrapped. It calculates the full length on a single line.
- This forced this design to set a min and max value to compensate. 

Using training Pack [Follow and Adjust](https://myimagine-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/jriver13_imaginecommunications_com/ElpdFd6zxbRCpEV0s1pgjp8BUOXzdk1gxNXmoWpoy6RqvA?e=rsYv3m)

---

### Session 12 Height
- üéØ  In this session we will create 1 item, another promo, again this promo will hold realtime text objects - but in addition this example demonstrates how expressions can be used to make the design more scalable and adaptable to the content.

- This examples uses multiple NULL objects to position elements so they are always appropriately stacked based on the number of lines in the title.

- Each NULL counts the number of lines and moves itself appropriately to adjust. The NEXT and LATER  NULL objects als look at the the lines in the other objects to move extra accourding to their lines. 

Using training Pack [NNL Height](https://myimagine-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/jriver13_imaginecommunications_com/ElpdFd6zxbRCpEV0s1pgjp8BUOXzdk1gxNXmoWpoy6RqvA?e=rsYv3m)

---

### Session 13 Move the Bug in RealTime
- üéØ  In this session we will create 1 item, this time another bug. But a bug with a difference - one that can be moved - in realtime.... Lets learn how this is done.

Using training Pack [Moving Bug](https://myimagine-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/jriver13_imaginecommunications_com/ElpdFd6zxbRCpEV0s1pgjp8BUOXzdk1gxNXmoWpoy6RqvA?e=rsYv3m)

This sample uses expressions to move a bug around based on real time text values. 
The text values are off canvas to the right.
- Aspect Ratio
- Position
- UP
- DOWN
- LEFT
- RIGHT

- Aspect Ratio is expecting SD value. Any thing else it will assume HD
- Position expecting UR, UL, LL, LR - default is UR (Upper Right, Upper Left, Lower Left...)
- UP, Down, Left and Right are offsets that can be entered by the operator.

- This has also been built to work in Real Time. To remove real time capability, remove the loop.

- The bug has been made a real time media object. It can be on a local versio, network or store in the layout as the Layout sample provided.

---

### Session 14 Creating Crawls and Rolls 
- üéØ  In this session we will create 1 item, a crawl. Again we will use comp markers and realtime objects. 

 A scroll is defined as any moving text object built using a scroll method. This could be a roll or a crawl.

1. Create a Rectangle and mark this object as a scroll object
2. Create a Real Time text object and any other real time objects and add on top of Scroll object. The scroll object can be made transparent if you don‚Äôt wnat to show it. This collection of RT elements will represent 1 record. Versio will generate a new record for each data set and stitch it together so it scrolls.
3. Set the parent for each real time elemen to the Crawl Object
4. Animate the Rectangle in the direction you want your crawl/roll to move (any angle!)
5. The first two frames of the shape define the direction. The speed is set by how far it moves. It does not have to animate all the way across the screen.
6. Add a pause CTC action and resume trigger. The trigger will automatically fire when the crawl has finished.
7. Run RealTimeObject.jsx and render

Using training Pack [RT Scroll](https://myimagine-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/jriver13_imaginecommunications_com/ElpdFd6zxbRCpEV0s1pgjp8BUOXzdk1gxNXmoWpoy6RqvA?e=rsYv3m)

####¬†Soft Crawls
A soft mask, is a regular shape mask with a gradient that uses a Luma track mask (regular or inverted - this sample uses Inverted)
Now, if you want to have custom gradient stops you need to edit the XMP after you run the script. AE does not expose the gradient stops to scripting so we cannot generate it automatically.

After the gradient fill, add these lines wiht the stops you require:

Gradient Fill=-728.639023217344,0,735.071908293378,0,100
Custom Gradient Stop=true
Gradient Stops=0.1,0.9

You can add the stops that are necessary. This example starts at 0.1 and ends at 0.9 % way through the distance. 

- Understand the options that are listed to us in the Creation Station 

---

### Session 15  - Pull from data source - Needs to be updated 
This example illustrates how to use CTC triggers to pull from a data source.

Pull = RT Tag Name
This command can be used to get the next record in a specific text object. It will allow you to update the text object when and how you would like. The animation needs to be playing so it can update.

RTTagName = Requery
This will requery the data source. Use this if you are reading a single record and would like to get the updated value. This would be good for real time data such as a live poll.

---

### Session 16 Live Updating Poll Charts
- üéØ  In this session we will create 1 item, a live updating poll. This will use realtime objects to achieve our goals along with comp marker loops

- These examples show how you can make a bar chart and/or Real Time poll.
If you have a data source that gives you the percentage, you can Bind it to the 

- POLL example resutls. This assumes it will update giving two values that equal 100%. 
- If you don‚Äôt have that you can bind it to the Manual Poll where you can connect it to the number of votes and the AE file will calculate the  final percentage.
- The bars change scale based on the percentage value. 
- The Manual Poll should animate between the two values. This is achieved with an expression that is rather complicated but easy to replicate. 

Using training Pack [Chart Poll](https://myimagine-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/jriver13_imaginecommunications_com/ElpdFd6zxbRCpEV0s1pgjp8BUOXzdk1gxNXmoWpoy6RqvA?e=rsYv3m)

---

### Session 16 DVE
- üéØ  In this session we will create 2 items, a single DVE and a DUAL DVE. Digital Video Effects for Squeeze backs etc.  DVES are created in AE and rendered as .mov animations. We then use them in Layouts. 


Using training Pack [DVESQZl](https://myimagine-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/jriver13_imaginecommunications_com/ElpdFd6zxbRCpEV0s1pgjp8BUOXzdk1gxNXmoWpoy6RqvA?e=rsYv3m) 

About the training pack: 

2 DVEs can be added to your composition to animate the position, scale and opacity of your two sources.

Basics:
1. Create a new solid named DVE A and give it a color
2. Create another solid named DVE B and give it a different color. DVE/Solids must match this as it corresponds to the Zenium Blueprint.
3.  Animate as necessary. You need to add both A and B even though you may only want to do a single DVE squeeze
4. Start your DVE in the starting position and make sure you leave it in a good postion when the animation is finished.

Z-Order
1. To change the z-order of the graphics layer, and 2 video source layers use CTC triggers.
2. Insert a Layer Marker on the composition timeline with a label and add dve = g/a/b. Change the order of the graphics/a/b to swap the z order on that frame.

Ducking
1. To duck an audio source use CTC triggers
2. Add a layer marker where you want to begin the ducking with a label
3. Add the command Audio A = -60:0.5 or Audio B = 0:0.5. The first value is the ducking level in db and the second value is the time in seconds you would like to transition to that level.

Tips
1. Often you will want a look where graphics are both above and below your video source. To Achieve this, mask your graphics as necessary with the graphic layer on top.
